***** Medical Plant Image Classification Using Teachable Machine *****
This project focuses on developing an image-based medical plant identification system using Google Teachable Machine. The system is trained to recognize different medicinal plants commonly found in the Philippines by analyzing images of their leaves, flowers, and overall structure.
The goal of the project is to help users easily identify medicinal plants using a camera or uploaded images, which can support education, herbal research, and awareness of traditional medicine.
